## cosMix - A sound mixing engine for the Sony Playstation2

cosMix is the result of my attempt to create a sound engine easy to use under ps2sdk as alternative to PS2 SDLmixer while adding different features. Currently it's only partially compatible.

## Future features : 

Ogg/MP3/MOD streaming support while mixing regular samples.
